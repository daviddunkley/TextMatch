#eviivo Unattended MVC C# Coding Test – v1

##Requirements and Instructions

* Spend no longer than three hours on this problem. 
* Write the code in your usual style using C#. 
* Do not use external functionality to directly solve the problem – in particular do not use the 
built-in C# String class methods to find matches or substrings, for example the lastIndexOf() 
method, Regex libraries, Linq or similar. You may however hold Strings while your own 
algorithm does the matching. 
* Write an MVC application that fulfils the following requirements:
  * Accepts two strings as input parameters: one string is called “text” and the other is 
called “subtext” in this problem statement.
  * The application matches the subtext against the text, outputting the character 
positions of the beginning of each match for the subtext within the text. 
  * Multiple matches are possible. 
  * Matching is case insensitive. 
  * The application should be called “TextMatch” 
  * The results/output text should only contain the character positions with a comma 
between each position.  No spaces or other formatting should be returned.
  * The matches should be displayed within the MVC app.

##Examples of Test Data:

Input text is: `Polly put the kettle on, polly put the kettle on, polly put the kettle on we’ll all have tea`

Subtext `Polly` => Output `1,26,51`

Subtext `Polly` => Output `1,26,51` 

Subtext `ll` => Output `3,28,53,78,82`

Subtext `X` => Output `There is no output` 

Subtext `Polx` => Output `There is no output` 

Your code will be assessed as if it was a commercial application.  Your submission should include a 
Visual studio solution of your program.
